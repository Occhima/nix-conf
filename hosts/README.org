#+TITLE: NixOS Hosts
#+AUTHOR: occhima
#+DESCRIPTION: Host-specific NixOS configurations

* Overview

This directory contains host-specific NixOS configurations. Each host has its own directory with machine-specific settings, while inheriting shared modules and configurations.

* Directory Structure

- ~flake-module.nix~ - Exports all host configurations as nixosConfigurations
- ~deploy.nix~ - Configuration for remote deployment with deploy-rs
- ~hive.nix~ - Advanced configuration for host organization
- ~profiles/~ - Shared configurations for similar types of hosts
  - ~common/~ - Configuration shared by all hosts
  - ~desktop/~ - Desktop-specific configuration
  - ~headless/~ - Server/headless configuration
  - ~iso/~ - Configuration for bootable ISO images
  - ~wsl/~ - Configuration for Windows Subsystem for Linux

* Hosts

** crescendoll

Development environment in Windows Subsystem for Linux.

** face2face

ISO image with installer.

** steammachine

Gaming desktop system with NVIDIA GPU support.

* Host Definition

Each host directory typically contains:

- ~default.nix~ - Main system configuration
- ~hardware.nix~ - Hardware-specific settings (optional)
- ~disko.nix~ - Disk partitioning configuration (optional)
- ~rekeyed/~ - Host-specific rekey files for agenix

* Profiles

Profiles in the ~profiles/~ directory group common settings for different types of systems:

** common

Settings shared by all hosts, including:
- Environment settings
- System settings
- Nix configuration
- Common packages

** desktop

Settings for desktop/laptop installations:
- GUI applications
- Desktop environment
- Gaming support
- Multimedia

** headless

Settings for servers without a GUI:
- Server services
- Minimal environment
- Performance optimizations

** iso

Settings for bootable ISO images:
- Installation media configuration
- Live system settings

** wsl

Settings for Windows Subsystem for Linux:
- WSL-specific settings
- Integration with Windows

* Adding a New Host

To add a new host:

1. Create a new directory under ~hosts/~ (e.g., ~hosts/newhost/~)
2. Add a ~default.nix~ file with the host configuration
3. Optionally add ~hardware.nix~ and ~disko.nix~ files
4. Register the host in ~hosts/flake-module.nix~

Example host registration in ~hosts/flake-module.nix~:

#+begin_src nix
hosts = {
  # Existing hosts...

  newhost = {
    deployable = true;  # or false if this isn't for remote deployment
    path = ./newhost;
    modules = [
      # Select appropriate profiles
      desktop  # For desktop systems
      # or
      headless # For servers
    ];
  };
};
#+end_src

* Remote Deployment

To deploy a host remotely, add it to the ~deploy.nix~ file:

#+begin_src nix
nodes = {
  # Existing nodes...

  "newhost" = {
    hostname = "10.0.0.2";  # Replace with actual IP or hostname
    profiles.system = {
      user = "root";
      path = nixosConfigurations.newhost;
    };
  };
};
#+end_src

Then deploy using:

#+begin_src bash
just install newhost
#+end_src
